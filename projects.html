                        I first want to start off this email by saying thank you so much on behalf of our organization
                        for the generous donation of sports equipment. We are all in unprecedented times trying to get
                        back to some sense of normalcy and with the sports equipment we were able to take a step in the
                        right direction. Most of our sites are being facilitated through zoom or google meet calls which
                        means kids are stuck at home all day, there were some many ideas we had as an organization to
                        get the kids active but were not sure of the equipment they all had at home. With the donation
                        we were able to get some soccer and dodgeballs out to our members and create a program around
                        that. We often don't realize some families may have it tougher than others so seeing the smiles
                        on the kids faces receiving their new equipment was extremely gratifying and a positive moment
                        in these tough times. Again we can't say it enough, thank you for considering us!

                        "Ishan's generosity could not have come at a better time for our school. At this moment the
                        Hollister School District is going through a rough financial time and we were unable to purchase
                        new playground equipment and art supplies for our students. The current equipment we have is
                        worn out, has small rips, and some have slow leaks that creates a daily need to inflate them. He
                        donated dozens of new balls for our students. We immediately put them into use and put them in
                        our playground ball cart. Now, students have new equipment to play with every day. It is an
                        absolute joy to hear their laughs and screams of delight as they participate in recess
                        activities with their friends. We also put the art supplies into immediate use placing them in
                        various classrooms and the library for students to enjoy. This donation was timely and perfect
                        for what the students of Sunnyslope School needed. Thank you Ishan!"
